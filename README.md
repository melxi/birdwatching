In the project directory first install dependencies by running coomand "npm install" and then run "npm run build" command
when done view the app in [http://localhost:3001]

I used Node.js with MongoDB for fetching data to React and redux for manipulating state and saving it localStorage so observations added to database could be viewed also locally when offline.
This was a good experience for me because I had to learn more technologies to add some features I hadn't used earlier and pushed me to learn even more and think differently how to accomplish certain problems while doing this assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
